### OSI Architecture

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand network interactions through seven distinct layers. These layers guide the design and implementation of network protocols to ensure interoperability between different systems and technologies.

1. **Physical Layer**  
2. **Data Link Layer**  
3. **Network Layer**  
4. **Transport Layer**  
5. **Session Layer**  
6. **Presentation Layer**  
7. **Application Layer**

#### 1. Physical Layer  
The Physical Layer defines the hardware elements that handle the transmission and reception of raw data over a physical medium, such as cables or wireless signals. It includes standards for electrical signals, connectors, and data encoding. For example, Ethernet adheres to specific standards that define its physical properties, ensuring devices can connect and communicate effectively.

#### 2. Data Link Layer  
The Data Link Layer provides node-to-node data transfer and handles error detection and correction from the Physical Layer. It ensures that data frames are delivered to the correct device on a network segment. Protocols at this layer, such as Ethernet, CAN, or custom protocols like UART, define how data is packaged for transmission. For example, the CAN protocol follows a specific standard, while UART might require custom-defined logical frames or data formats.

#### 3. Network Layer  
The Network Layer is responsible for routing packets between devices across different networks. It handles logical addressing, such as IP addresses, and determines the best path for data to travel. In a CAN network with multiple nodes, all nodes must use the same network protocol, like IPv4 or IPv6. Since IPv4 does not define a Physical Layer, it relies on the Data Link and Physical Layers for actual data transmission. Therefore, protocols from Layers 3 to 7 must utilize Layers 1 and 2 for transmitting data across the network.

 | Ethernet  |              |

```

#### 4. Transport Layer  
The Transport Layer ensures end-to-end communication by providing reliable data transfer services. It includes protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol), which manage the segmentation of large data streams into smaller packets and reassemble them at the destination. TCP uses a three-way handshake to establish connections, ensuring reliable communication.

- The transmitter processes data through Layers 7 to 1.
- The receiver processes data through Layers 1 to 7.

Port numbers identify specific applications, such as port 69 for DHCP. When connecting to or receiving data from another device, the data first arrives via Ethernet, with the protocol and standard detected at the Data Link Layer. The IP address is checked at the Network Layer to determine whether to receive data via TCP or UDP.

#### 5. Application Layer  
The Application Layer is the topmost layer, where end-user protocols like HTTP, FTP, DNS, and DHCP reside. It provides network services directly to user applications, enabling them to communicate over a network. For instance, when a user accesses a website, the HTTP protocol operates at this layer to facilitate the transfer of web pages.

### TCP/IP Architecture

The TCP/IP model is a simplified version of the OSI model, commonly used in network communications. It consists of four layers that correspond to specific functions in the OSI model:

1. **Link Layer** (Combines the Data Link and Physical Layers from the OSI model)
2. **Internet Layer** (Corresponds to the Network Layer)
3. **Transport Layer**  
4. **Application Layer** (Combines the remaining layers from the OSI model)

### Why Ethernet Is Adopted in the Automotive Industry

Ethernet technology is increasingly adopted in the automotive industry, primarily due to the development of Broad-R Reach by Prodcome company. Broad-R Reach allows two nodes to communicate using just two wires instead of the eight wires used in standard Ethernet. This innovation uses the concept of a differential pair, where the payload or frame remains the same, but the physical layer differs. The significant difference between standard Ethernet and Broad-R Reach lies in their physical layers, with Broad-R Reach requiring only two wires for communication.

### Ethernet Layer Overview

When considering two microcontrollers (MC1 and MC2):

- **MC1** requires a MAC (Media Access Control) and a PHY (Physical Layer Device).
- **MC2** also requires a MAC and a PHY, but depending on the setup, it may need an RJ45 connector or a converter if RJ45 is not available.

The connection would look like this:

```
MC1                                                      MC2
MAC ------ PHY (RJ45)                                    MAC ------ PHY (RJ45)
 -------------------------                               -------------------------
|                     |   |----                       ---|   |                    |
|                     |mac|phy |                     |phy|mac|                    |
|                     |   |----                       ---|   |                    |
 -------------------------                                ------------------------

```


### Media Independent Interface (MII)

The Media Independent Interface (MII) allows the MAC to communicate with different types of PHYs, whether an RJ45 connector is used or not. MACs can communicate using MII, RMII (Reduced MII), or RGMII (Reduced Gigabit MII), providing flexibility in connecting different types of Ethernet PHYs.

### Physical Layer (PHY)

The physical layer of Ethernet, particularly in 100Base-Tx, includes several sublayers:

- **Physical Coding Sublayer (PCS):** Converts 3 bits into 2 bits, handling data encoding and decoding to ensure that the transmitted data is correctly interpreted by the receiver.
- **Physical Medium Attachment (PMA):** The final sublayer in the physical layer stack, PMA interfaces with the physical medium, such as cables, ensuring the correct transmission of data over the network.

The PHY layers can be visualized as:

```
   ------------------------
   |        |        |     |
MII|  PCS   |        | PMA |MDI
   |        |        |     |
   ------------------------
```

### Unicast, Multicast, and Broadcast

- **Unicast:** A one-to-one communication between a single sender and a single receiver.
- **Multicast:** A one-to-many communication where data is sent to multiple specific receivers.
- **Broadcast:** A one-to-all communication where data is sent to all devices in the network segment.

### Ethernet Frame Structure

An Ethernet frame consists of the following components:

```
Dst MAC  |  Src MAC  |  Length/Type  |  Payload (IPv4 Header + IPv4 Payload)
6 bytes    6 bytes      2 bytes       1500 bytes
```

If the payload exceeds 1500 bytes, the Length/Type field indicates that the frame carries a specific protocol type instead of just the length. For example:
- `0x0800` indicates an IPv4 packet, which is handled at the Network Layer.
- `0x0806` indicates an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) packet, used to discover the MAC address associated with an IP address.
- `0x86DD` indicates an IPv6 packet.

### TCAM in Ethernet Switching

TCAM (Ternary Content Addressable Memory) is used in network switches to efficiently route packets to the correct destination. When a switch receives a packet, it uses TCAM to quickly determine the correct MAC address and forwards the packet to the appropriate device. If the MAC address is unknown, the switch broadcasts the packet to all connected devices (AutoLAN or broadcast), stopping once it receives an acknowledgment from the correct recipient.

### VLAN vs. Multicast (Untagged Frame)

- **VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network):** VLANs segment a physical network into multiple logical networks, allowing devices within the same VLAN to communicate as if they were on the same physical network, even if they are on different segments.
- **Multicast (Untagged Frame):** Multicast allows data transmission to multiple devices simultaneously without sending separate copies to each device. This is often used for applications like streaming video, where the same content is sent to multiple recipients.

### Inter-Network Device Communication

To connect devices from different networks, a router (Layer 3 device) is used, which forwards packets between networks. Switches (Layer 2 devices) handle communication within the same network segment.

### PTP Protocol Over Ethernet

Precision Time Protocol (PTP) is used over Ethernet to synchronize clocks across devices in a network, ensuring precise timing for critical applications. PTP is essential in environments where accurate time synchronization is crucial, such as in financial trading systems or telecommunications.

### Transport Layer

The Transport Layer provides reliable data transfer services and includes two main protocols:

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** TCP ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data. It includes features like acknowledgment (ACK), synchronization (SYN), and finalization (FIN) flags.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** UDP is a connectionless protocol that provides fast data transmission without error checking or acknowledgment. It is suitable for applications where speed
